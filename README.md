# Improving "Reasoning" in Large Language Models via Representation Engineering

This repository comprises the code that accompanies the paper [Improving "Reasoning" in Large Language Models via Representation Engineering](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=IssPhpUsKt) presented at ICLR 2025. We apply control vectors to modulate the reasoning performance of various LLMs.

## Instructions

We developed `repana` to extract hidden states and derive control vectors. The `repana` framework is based on [repeng](https://github.com/vgel/repeng) (MIT License), a very nice library for training control vectors!

### Installation

We manage our environment using `uv`. 

### Replication

To replicate our experiments follow these instructions:
