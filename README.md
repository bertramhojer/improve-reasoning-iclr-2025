# Improving "Reasoning" in Large Language Models via Representation Engineering

This repository comprises the code that accompanies the paper [Improving "Reasoning" in Large Language Models via Representation Engineering](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=IssPhpUsKt) presented at ICLR 2025. We apply control vectors to modulate the reasoning performance of various LLMs.

## Instructions

We developed `repana` to extract hidden states and derive control vectors. The `repana` framework is based on [repeng](https://github.com/vgel/repeng) (MIT License), a very nice library for training control vectors!

### Installation

We manage our environment using `uv`. Assuming you've cloned and navigated to the repository (and don't have `uv` installed), follow these steps to set up your environment (unix systems).

To install `uv` run:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Create a virtual environment and activate it:
```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Unix-like systems
```
Install dependencies:
```bash
# Install from requirements.txt
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Our experiments were run using the HPC at the IT University of Copenhagen. It was unfeasible to run the experiments with e.g. 7B parameter models locally. If you have a GPU avaiable the `repana` framework should automatically push your model to GPU, enabling you to run experiments with larger models.

### Replication

We manage hyperparameters using Hydra. To replicate our experiments follow these instructions:

Deriving control-vectors based on the hyperparameters for experiment 1.
```bash
uv run train experiment=experiment1
```

Evaluating control-vectors based on the hyperparameters for experiment 1.
```bash
uv run evaluate experiment=experiment1
```
